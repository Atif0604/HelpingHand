## Mission

There are thousands of children in the world who receive little to nothing to eat when they are not at school. <b>Helping Hand</b> is here to provide these children with nutritious food so that they can grow, learn, and thrive among their peers. 
Additionally, we believe in the power of a community working together toward the common goal of fighting malnutrition in our country.
<b>Helping Hand</b> wants to improve the quality of life and empower the children of rural arears with the tools and resources to be able to read and write.
When you donate to us, you partner with us in achieving our mission of transforming lives and neighborhoods through affordable housing and supportive programs. Your support will help families in need and those with special needs, support seniors and give new hope to the homeless.

Even helping one individual can make a small change for the better.
